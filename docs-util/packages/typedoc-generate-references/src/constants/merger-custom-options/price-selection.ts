:::note

If you created your price selection strategy in a plugin, refer to [this guide on how to test plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/create#test-your-plugin).

:::

After finishing your price selection strategy implementation:

1\\. Run the \`build\` command in the root of your Medusa backend:

\`\`\`bash npm2yarn
npm run build
\`\`\`

2\\. Start the backend with the \`develop\` command:

\`\`\`bash
npx medusa develop
\`\`\`

3\\. To test out your price selection strategy implementation, you can retrieve a product and it's variants by specifying pricing parameters as explained in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/storefront/show-products#product-pricing-parameters).
