# Medusa React

[Medusa React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medusa-react) is a React library that provides a set of utilities and hooks for interacting seamlessly with the Medusa backend.

For example, if you're creating a storefront with frameworks like Nuxt, you can send requests to the backend using this client. You can also use it in your Medusa admin customizations.

This reference provides details on the available hooks, providers, and utilities, including examples of each.

## Installation

In the directory holding your React-based storefront or admin dashboard, run the following command to install Medusa React:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install medusa-react @tanstack/react-query@4.22 @medusajs/medusa
```

In addition to the `medusa-react` library, you need the following libraries:

1. `@tanstack/react-query`: `medusa-react` is built on top of [Tanstack Query v4.22](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview). You’ll learn later in this reference how you can use Mutations and Queries with Medusa React.
2. `@medusajs/medusa`: The core Medusa package. This is used to import types used by Medusa React and while developing with it.

:::info

Part of the Medusa roadmap is to move the types into a separate package, removing the need to install the core Medusa package in your storefront or admin dashboard. You can check other items on our roadmap in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions/categories/roadmap).

## Usage

To use the hooks exposed by Medusa React, include the `MedusaProvider` somewhere up in your component tree.

The `MedusaProvider` requires two props:

1. `baseUrl`: The URL to your Medusa backend
2. `queryClientProviderProps`: An object used to set the Tanstack Query client. The object requires a `client` property, which should be an instance of [QueryClient](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/QueryClient).

Learn about other optional props in [this reference](../references/medusa_react/Providers/medusa_react.Providers.Medusa.mdx)

For example:

```tsx title="src/App.ts"
import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
import Storefront from "./Storefront"
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import React from "react"

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MedusaProvider
      queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
      baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
    >
      <Storefront />
    </MedusaProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

In the example above, you wrap the `Storefront` component with the `MedusaProvider`. `Storefront` is assumed to be the top-level component of your storefront, but you can place `MedusaProvider` at any point in your tree.

Only children of `MedusaProvider` can benefit from its hooks. So, the `Storefront` component and its child components can now use hooks exposed by Medusa React.

  <Summary>Troubleshooting: Could not find a declaration file for module 'medusa-react'</Summary>

  If you import `medusa-react` in your code and see the following TypeScript error:

  ```bash
  Could not find a declaration file for module 'medusa-react'
  ```

  Make sure to set `moduleResolution` in your `tsconfig.json` to `nodenext` or `node`:

  ```json title="tsconfig.json"
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "moduleResolution": "nodenext",
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```
</Details>

## How to Use this Reference

You'll find in the sidebar three main categories to explore:

- Hooks: Includes all hooks used to send requests to the backend. Hooks are also split into Admin hooks that send requests to the admin, and Store hooks, that send requests to the store.
- Providers: Includes React providers helpful for your development using Medusa React.
- Utilities: Utility functions that are mainly useful for displaying product and variant pricing.

## Queries and Mutations

Since Medusa React is built on top of Tanstack Queries, hooks can either be queries or mutations.

### Queries

To fetch data from the Medusa backend (in other words, perform `GET` requests), you can use [Queries](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries). 

Query hooks simply wrap around Tanstack Query's `useQuery` hook to fetch data from your Medusa backend.

For example, to fetch products from your Medusa backend:

```tsx title="src/Products.ts"
import { Product } from "@medusajs/medusa"
import { useProducts } from "medusa-react"

const Products = () => {
  const { products, isLoading } = useProducts()

  return isLoading ? (
    <div>
      Loading...
    </div>
  ) : (
    <ul>
      {products?.map((product: Product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          {product.title}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Products
```

In the example above, you import the `useProducts` hook from `medusa-react`. 

This hook, and every other query hook exposed by `medusa-react`, returns everything that `useQuery` [returns in Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery), except for the `data` field. Instead of the `data` field, the response data is flattened and is part of the hooks’ returned fields (see `products` in the example above).

You can learn more about using queries in [Tanstack Query’s documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/queries).

### Mutations

To create, update, or delete data on the Medusa backend (in other words, perform `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests), you can use [Mutations](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations).

Mutation hooks wrap around Tanstack Query's `useMutation` to mutate data on your Medusa backend.

For example, to create a cart:

```tsx title="src/Cart.ts"
import { useCreateCart } from "medusa-react"

const Cart = () => {
  const createCart = useCreateCart()
  const handleClick = () => {
    createCart.mutate({}) // create an empty cart
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {createCart.isLoading && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {!createCart.data?.cart && (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
          Create cart
        </button>
      )}
      {createCart.data?.cart?.id && (
        <div>Cart ID: {createCart.data?.cart.id}</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Cart
```

In the example above, you import the `useCreateCart` hook from `medusa-react`. This hook, and every other mutation hook exposed by `medusa-react`, returns everything that [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useMutation) returns. You can also pass the same options you would pass to `useMutation` to mutation hooks exposed by `medusa-react`.

To create a cart, you call the `createCart.mutate` method. In the underlying logic, this method sends a `POST` request to the Medusa backend to create a cart.

If the request accepts any parameters, they can be passed as parameters to the `mutate` request. For example:

```ts
createCart.mutate({
  region_id,
})
```

Instead of using `mutate`, you can use `mutateAsync` to receive a Promise that resolves on success or throws on error.

Learn more about how you can use mutations in [Tanstack Query’s documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/mutations).

## Authentication

### Admin Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate an admin user:

1. Using the [useAdminLogin hook](../references/medusa_react/Hooks/Admin/medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Auth.mdx#useadminlogin). This hook tries to authenticate the user by their email and password credential and, if successful, attaches the cookie session ID to subsequent requests.
2. Using the `apiKey` option of the [MedusaProvider](../references/medusa_react/Providers/medusa_react.Providers.Medusa.mdx#medusaprovider) if the admin has an API key. If the admin doesn't have an API key, you can create one using the [useAdminUpdateUser hook](../references/medusa_react/Hooks/Admin/medusa_react.Hooks.Admin.Users.mdx#useAdminUpdateUser) or the [Update User API route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#users_postusersuser).

For example:

<Tabs groupId="admin-auth" isCodeTabs={true}>
  <TabItem value="useadminlogin" label="useAdminLogin hook" default>

    ```ts
    import React from "react"
    import { useAdminLogin } from "medusa-react"

    const Login = () => {
      const adminLogin = useAdminLogin()
      // ...

      const handleLogin = () => {
        adminLogin.mutate({
          email: "user@example.com",
          password: "supersecret",
        }, {
          onSuccess: ({ user }) => {
            console.log(user)
            // send authenticated requests now
          }
        })
      }

      // ...
    }

    export default Login
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="apikey" label="apiKey Option">

    ```ts
    import { MedusaProvider } from "medusa-react"
    import Storefront from "./Storefront"
    import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
    import React from "react"

    const queryClient = new QueryClient()

    const App = () => {
      return (
        <MedusaProvider
          queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}
          baseUrl="http://localhost:9000"
          apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
        >
          <Storefront />
        </MedusaProvider>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Customer Authentication

To authenticate a customer, use the [useMedusa hook](../references/medusa_react/Providers/medusa_react.Providers.Medusa.mdx#usemedusa) to access the underlying [Medusa JS Client](../js-client/overview.mdx) instance and use one of its [authentication methods](../js-client/overview.mdx#authentication), such as the [authenticate](../references/js_client/classes/js_client.AuthResource.mdx#authenticate) method.

For example:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { useMeCustomer, useMedusa } from "medusa-react"

const CustomerLogin = () => {
  const { client } = useMedusa()
  const { refetch: refetchCustomer } = useMeCustomer()
  // ...

  const handleLogin = (
    email: string,
    password: string
  ) => {
    client.auth.authenticate({
      email,
      password,
    })
    .then(() => {
      // customer is logged-in successfully
      // send authenticated requests now
      refetchCustomer()
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // an error occurred.
    })
  }

  // ...
}
```
:::note

The refetch method is available through [Tanstack Query's useQuery hook](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery). It allows you to refetch data if a change occurs. In this case, you refetch the logged-in customer after authentication.
