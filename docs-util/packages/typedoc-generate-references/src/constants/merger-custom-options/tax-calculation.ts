:::note

If you created your tax calculation strategy in a plugin, refer to [this guide on how to test plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/create#test-your-plugin).

:::

After finishing your tax calculation strategy implementation:

1\\. Run the \`build\` command in the root of your Medusa backend:

\`\`\`bash npm2yarn
npm run build
\`\`\`

2\\. Start the backend with the \`develop\` command:

\`\`\`bash
npx medusa develop
\`\`\`

3\\. To test out your tax calculation strategy implementation, you can [trigger taxes calculation manually](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/taxes/storefront/manual-calculation).

    ],
  },
}

export default taxCalculationOptions
