# Cart Concepts

In this document, you’ll get an overview of the main concepts of a cart.

## Shipping and Billing Addresses

A cart has a shipping and billing address. Both of these addresses are represented by the `Address` data model.

## Line Items

A line item, represented by the `LineItem` data model, is a product added to the cart. A cart has multiple line items.

A line item stores some of the product’s fields, such as the `product_title` and `product_description`. It also stores data related to the item’s quantity and price.

<Note>

A product can be from the [Product Module](../../product/index.mdx) but can also be a custom item used only in this cart.

## Shipping Methods

A shipping method is the method used to fulfill the items in the cart after the order is placed. A cart can have more than one shipping method.

If the shipping method is created from a shipping option, typically available through the Fulfillment Module, its ID is stored in the `shipping_option_id`.

A shipping method can also be a custom method associated with this cart only.
